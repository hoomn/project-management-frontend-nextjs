This is the frontend of a project management tool, built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org). It provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with [the backend API](https://github.com/hoomn/project-management-backend), offering features such as task management and project tracking.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
